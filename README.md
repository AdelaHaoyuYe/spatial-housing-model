A Spatial Agent-Based Model of the UK Housing Market
====================================================

This is a spatial agent-based model of the UK housing market written by the Institute of New Economic Thinking (INET)
at the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford. It is based on a previous non-spatial model developed by INET in
collaboration with the Bank of England. A detailed description of this initial non-spatial model can be found as a
[Staff Working Paper of the Bank of England ](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/workingpapers/2016/swp619.aspx).

The spatial model, while keeping the same agents as in the non-spatial version (owner-occupiers, renters, buy-to-let
investors, a private bank, a central bank, a construction sector, and a government), incorporates a number of spatial
features with their corresponding agent behaviours. Namely, households have to decide where to bid for housing given a
certain spatial distribution of prices and commuting costs. These decisions, in turn, feed back into the market
mechanism, possibly modifying the spatial distribution of prices.
